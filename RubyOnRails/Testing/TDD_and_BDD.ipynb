    "When applying <b>test-driven development (TDD)</b>, developers can easily fall into the trap of using unit tests to test what an object or method is, rather than what it does, which is a lot more useful.\n",
    "<b>BDD</b> puts focus on behavior — what a thing does — on all levels of development\n",
    "Given some context or state of the world, <b>When something happens, Then we expect some outcome</b>.\n",
    "In practice, BDD implies an outside-in approach: starting with an acceptance test, we begin writing code in the views and work our way down to the models.\n",
    "The BDD cycle in Rails consists of the following steps:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Start with a new Cucumber scenario. How the user interface allows a user to do a job</li>\n",
    "    <li>Run the scenario and watch it fail. This will tell you which steps are failing, or pending implementation.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Write a definition of the first failing or pending spec. Run the scenario and watch it fail.</li>\n",
    "    <li>You'll discover instance variables, controllers and controller actions that the view will need to do its job.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Make sure that the instance variables are assigned and that the actions respond correctly. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Test-drive those objects using the same red-green-refactor cycle with RSpec. Make sure that they provide the methods needed by the controller and the view. </li>\n",
    "    <li>Once you have implemented all the objects and methods you need and the corresponding specs are passing. run the Cucumber ==> make sure step is satisfied</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
